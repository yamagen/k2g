# Glossing Guidelines for "na...so" and "e...zu" Constructions in Classical Japanese

Last updated: 2025/11/25-15:54:13

This document outlines principles for glossing the classical Japanese constructions "na...so" and "e...zu", which express prohibition and impossibility respectively. The goal is to record grammatical function using semantic features rather than relying on traditional grammatical labels. The glosses are designed to reflect inter-word structure, especially when component morphemes are discontinuous.

## 1. "e...zu" Construction (Impossibility)

### Example:

```json
[
  { "word": "e", "gloss": "POT^1" },
  { "word": "masara", "gloss": "surpass.IRR" },
  { "word": "zu", "gloss": "NEG^2" }
]
```

### Note:

> **POT^1 + NEG^2**: In the classical construction "e...zu", "e" introduces a potential frame, which is explicitly negated by "zu". The entire construction expresses impossibility.

## 2. "na...so" Construction (Prohibition)

### Example:

```json
[
  { "word": "na", "gloss": "PROH^1" },
  { "word": "naki", "gloss": "cry.ADV" },
  { "word": "so", "gloss": "CMD^2" }
]
```

### Note:

> **PROH^1 + CMD^2**: "na...so" is a classical prohibitive construction. "Na" serves as a soft initiator of prohibition, while "so" (possibly derived from the imperative form of "su") functions as a gentle commandal closure.

## 3. Glossing Principles

- Glosses reflect **semantic and grammatical function**, not traditional grammatical labels.
- Use `^1`, `^2`, etc., **only when elements are structurally separated**.
- For morphologically fused forms like "nikeri" or "temu", treat as single units with unified glosses (e.g., `PERF.EMPH`, `INTENT.MOD`). These do **not** require separate construction entries.
- Historical etymology may be included in notes, but glosses should prioritize grammatical behavior.

---

## 4. Planned Additions

- Positional shifts in co-occuring elements (e.g., "na" or "zo" moving from medial to final position)

Note: Forms like "nikeri" and "temu", which are contiguous and semantically fused, should be glossed as single morphemes. They do not require independent structural construction entries.

All additions will follow the same principles: minimal gloss per morpheme, clear grammatical function, and optional historical/functional annotations.
